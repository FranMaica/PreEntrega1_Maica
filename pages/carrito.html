                    Season 13 Rewards and Plunder Pass

                    the new rewards and check your pirate’s progress!

                    Season 13 Emissary Ledger Rewards
                    This Season, the Guild Emissary Ledgers offer the ‘Secrets of the Ancient Flame’ Painting, Dark Hand
                    of Fate Ornament and Guild of Fiery Spirits Title to Guilds who represent them well and perform
                    proudly in the Ledgers.
                    The Trading Company Emissary Ledgers have been refreshed this month with the previously lost Pocket
                    Watches. Players can therefore now earn the Tribute Peak, Relic of Darkness, Merchant Ambassador,
                    Masked Renegade and Magpie’s Glory Pocket Watches when reaching the top tier of the Ledgers. Players
                    who have previously unlocked all rewards within the Ledgers will find these new Pocket Watches
                    already in their Equipment Chests!
                    Chest of Fortune
                    The Chest of Fortune has now been locked away in the belly of the Burning Blade, challenging crews
                    to sink this formidable ship to claim its prize.
                    Crews who retrieve Chests of Fortune can now earn the next Grade of the Fortune’s Favour
                    Commendation, unlocking access to the Fates of Fortune Fishing Rod, Shovel, Pocket Watch, Tankard
                    and Speaking Trumpet.
                    An additional reward has been retroactively added to Grade II of the Fortune’s Favour Commendation,
                    which now contains the Fates of Fortune Gloves. Players who already earned Grade II prior to this
                    update will be able to purchase the gloves from the Outpost clothing shops straight away.
                    Reaper’s Chests
                    Crews chasing down the telltale beacon of the Reaper’s Chest or Reaper’s Bounty can earn the next
                    Grade of the Reaper’s Riches Commendation, and start unlocking access to the Fates of Fortune
                    Hurdy-Gurdy, Concertina and Scar.
