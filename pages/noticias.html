                            The middle lines of the ID card have been removed to make space for the new background designs (funds / ready status)
                            A ready sticker will now appear on the player ID card when that player is ready
                            Fixed several Lobby-Equipment desync issues between players
                            UI will no longer overlap when applying a locked difficulty

                            The thermometer tiers now highlight correctly when hovering over them

                            Full 4.2 Changelog
                            New playable character: Frank Morello
                            New, revamped in-game emote system, along with a variety of unique, unlockable emotes that are earned by completing any map with a playable character on Hard difficulty 
                            (with new associated achievements)
                            Golden robes that can be unlocked for each playable character by beating any map on Nightmare difficulty (with new associated achievements)
                            New purchasable pet: Crow
                            New Halloween unlockable Kai outfit: Hollow. Unlocked by completing any map with Kai on Hard or Nightmare difficulty during the Halloween event. 
                            After the Halloween event ends the outfit will become a purchasable outfit.
                            A whole range of fun, new purchasable outfits!
                            10 new pumpkins to collect on Slaughterhouse to unlock the Halloween robe.
                            (Note: Unfortunately it's possible you may need to collect the new pumpkins to retain use of the Halloween robe if you had it before. This won't be necessary again, sorry!)
                            Fixed issues with flashlights not unlocking correctly after purchase
                            Fixed a spot on the Town where a player could escape out of bounds if crawling
                            Fixed gas tank texture appearing reversed on Slaughterhouse
                            Fixed an issue where hold mode for crouch didn't work correctly in VR
                            New controller glyphs for Dualshock/Dualsense controllers
                            Height of the VR camera in the menu now corresponds to player height in VR space for more realism
                            Vive controller VR hand synchronisation now more correctly matches controller rotation
                            The Invite Player button in lobby is now hidden in VR if you are not using SteamVR as your OpenXR runtime as a host
                            Corrected an issue that could cause a player to not laugh on completing a map objective on some maps
                            Keybinding UI changed from a grid to a list
                            Animals no longer lock on to food that they can see but they cannot get to. This was often a problem on the Asylum with rats seeing food through the shortcut drop hole
                            New mouse glyphs are used in keybindings and tutorials
                            Speaker icon in lobby used to indicate mic activity no longer flickers erractically.
                            Fixed an issue with controllers being unable to switch between perk groups
